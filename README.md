# TCBoatTweaker-Ultra
## What is this mod?
This mod modifies boats so that they may climb ice blocks. This is meant for use in worlds/servers with ice roads, which makes them a little easier to use. 
It does not modifiy any registries or add anything fancy, so it only needs to be installed on the client side and is not required on the server side.
## How do I use it?
Install it on your client. Supports 1.19.X. It may trigger anticheat protection, so beware when playing on servers with such features enabled!
